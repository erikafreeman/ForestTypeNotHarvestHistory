## ðŸ“– Background

Forests release dissolved organic matter (DOM) into streams, shaping water quality and ecosystem processes. While logging is often assumed to strongly affect DOM, this study shows that forest composition is the strongest driver of DOM quality at landscape scales.

The Timeweight method tests different temporal decay functions to model harvest impacts through time, providing a framework for cumulative impact assessment.

## Key findings:

Forest composition and soil moisture dominate DOM patterns.

Logging effects are weaker, only detectable in wet or recently harvested forests.

Harvest during wet conditions amplifies DOM changes and should be avoided.
